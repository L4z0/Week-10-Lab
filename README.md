## Milestone 6

* What vulnerabilities were beyond the control of the user?

Vulnerabilities that consist of social engineering other people who have your information. Such as in the example video of :What happens when you dare expert hackers to hack you...there the lady pretended to be the guy's wife and was able to lock him out from his own phone providers account with a baby crying in the background.

* What if anything could have been done by the user to mitigate the severity of the attack?

To mitigate the attack, one could require forms of authentication factors and request that if anyone tries to change an account or something to notify them right away.

* What could the user do to mitigate this, making a successful login impossible for the attacker even with the credentials? (Hint: FB         offers this as an option; not all sites do)


* Why might the username/password still be of value to the attacker even if she can't use them to login to Facebook? (Hint: think about how   users come up with passwords)

It might serve as credentials for other accounts.
